Project Overview
The Travel Explorer is a web application designed to simplify travel planning by providing key information about popular destinations, airlines, and travel partners in an engaging and interactive format. The website includes a navigation bar, a hero section, a search form for destination-based queries, and a carousel showcasing top travel options.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Features an intuitive navigation bar, search options, and visually appealing layout.
Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark modes using a single button, which applies the chosen theme across multiple pages for a cohesive experience.
Persistent User Preferences: User preferences (such as theme choice, login status, and selected filters) are saved in local storage, allowing preferences to be retained across sessions and page reloads.
Responsive Design: Ensures an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
User Preferences Management
User settings, such as theme mode and filters, are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, which allows the site to remember these preferences without requiring reconfiguration every visit.
